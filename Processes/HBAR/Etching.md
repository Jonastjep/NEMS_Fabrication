# HBAR Etching Process
## KOH based: KOH, AZ400K and H2O2 (Nanotalo)
|Chemical|Concentration|Etched Material|Etch Rate|Quick Recipe (approx 100ml)|
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
|KOH|KOH 15 wt% DIW|AlN|315 nm/min at RT|20g pure KOH in 100ml DIW|
|AZ400K|N/A|AlN|42 nm/min at RT|N/A|
|H2O2|H2O2 5%v/v DIW|Mo|25-30nm/min at RT|5ml H2O2 in 100ml DIW|

### I) First AlN Etching (KOH + AZ400K): Thin film removal
1. Spin coat chip with A9 PMMA, soft bake (**170°C for 90sec**). Spin Espacer and bake (**80°C for 60sec**). Pattern areas where AlN *and* Mo will be etched away. Rinse Espacer in water and develop with MIBK:IPA 1:3.
2. 30s-2min O2 dry etch for removal of residual resist.
3. Hard bake resist (**170°C for 10min**).
4. Put the chip gently into KOH solution for **60-80sec**. Agitate a little bit every once in a while.
5. Transfer to AZ400K beaker. Put the beaker in the ultrasonic bath (pwr 9) for **2.5-3min** without intermediated neutralization.
6. Neutralize in large amount of DIW.

### II) First/Short Mo Etching (H2O2): Thin film removal
1. In beaker, fill half with H2O2 solution and half with IPA (H2O2 solution 50%v/v IPA).
2. Add sample to beaker and leave to etch for **3min**.
3. Neutralize.

### III) Second AlN Etching (AZ400K): Seed layer removal
1. Return the sample into the AZ400K beaker for **30sec**.
2. Neutralize

### IV) Second/Long Mo Etching (H2O2): Underetch (etches the Mo under AlN, making a ledge)
1. In beaker, fill half with H2O2 solution and half with IPA (H2O2 solution 50%v/v IPA).
2. Add sample to beaker and leave to etch for **45-60min**.
3. Neutralize.

## NaOH based: AZ 531B and H2O2 (Micronova)
|Chemical|Concentration|Etched Material|Etch Rate|Quick Recipe (approx 100ml)|
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
|AZ 351B|N/A|AlN|?? nm/min at RT|N/A|
|H2O2|H2O2 5%v/v DIW|Mo|25-30nm/min at RT|5ml H2O2 in 100ml DIW|

### I) First AlN Etching (AZ 351B): Thin film removal
1. Spin coat chip with A9 PMMA, soft bake (**170°C for 90sec**). Spin Espacer and bake (**80°C for 60sec**). Pattern areas where AlN *and* Mo will be etched away. Rinse Espacer in water and develop with MIBK:IPA 1:3.
2. 30s-2min O2 dry etch for removal of residual resist.
3. Hard bake resist (**170°C for 10min**).
4. Put the chip gently into AZ 351B solution for **25min**. Agitate a little bit every once in a while (try with ultrasonic bath).
5. Neutralize in large amount of DIW.

### II) First/Short Mo Etching (H2O2): Thin film removal
1. In beaker, fill half with H2O2 solution and half with IPA (H2O2 solution 50%v/v IPA).
2. Add sample to beaker and leave to etch for **3min**.
3. Neutralize.

### III) Second AlN Etching (AZ 351B): Seed layer removal
1. Return the sample into the AZ 351B beaker for **1min**.
2. Neutralize

### IV) Second/Long Mo Etching (H2O2): Underetch (etches the Mo under AlN, making a ledge)
1. In beaker, fill half with H2O2 solution and half with IPA (H2O2 solution 50%v/v IPA).
2. Add sample to beaker and leave to etch for **45-60min**.
3. Neutralize.

## Appendix

at% signifies atomic percentage, so Cu-27at%Al would have 27% of the atoms in the alloy as Aluminium and 73% of the atoms in the alloy as Copper.

wt% signifies weight percentage, so Cu-27wt%Al would have 27% of the weight of the alloy as Aluminium and 73% of the weight of the alloy as Copper

Volume/volume percentage (v/v percent or %v/v) is a measure of the concentration of a substance in a solution. It is expressed as the ratio of the volume of the solute to the total volume of the solution multiplied by 100.
Examples: Wine has a typical alcohol content (v/v percent) of 12 percent. This means that there is 12 mL of ethanol in every 100 mL of wine.
